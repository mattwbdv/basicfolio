        <b>FaceFinder Web App</b>

        <br>
        As part of a React.js course, I created a FaceFinder web application. 
        The app leverages the Clarifai API to detect and identify all faces in photographs uploaded by the user. 
        The app then draws a box around each face. The app keeps a database of users, the number of photos they have uploaded, 
        and their contact information along with secure (encrypted) credentials.

        <br>
        When the COVID-19 crisis hit, I wanted to try and support people feeling lonely in the community, 
        so I built a small form and put it on a landing page to help people (particularly seniors) find a pen pal!
